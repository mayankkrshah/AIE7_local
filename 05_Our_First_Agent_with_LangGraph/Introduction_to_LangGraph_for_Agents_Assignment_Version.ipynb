        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

        "Is there any specific limit to how many times we can cycle?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, LangGraph enforces a default recursion limit of 25. That means an agent can cycle between nodes‚Äîlike \"agent\" and \"action\"‚Äîup to 25 times before the graph halts automatically. This built-in safeguard helps prevent infinite loops, runaway API calls, and excessive costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard way to impose a limit is by using the recursion_limit parameter when compiling the graph. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "graph = uncompiled_graph.compile(recursion_limit=5)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This sets a hard cap‚Äîonce the agent hits 5 recursive steps, the graph will stop automatically. It‚Äôs the recommended and built-in way to prevent runaway loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Apart from that, we can also add custom limits inside our node logic. One common method is checking how many messages have been exchanged:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if len(state[\"messages\"]) > 10:\n",
        "    return END\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This is helpful in chat scenarios where we want to stop after a certain number of back-and-forths.\n",
        "Another way is to look at the content of the message and stop based on a condition:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if \"STOP\" in state[\"latest_message\"][\"content\"]:\n",
        "    return END\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This gives more flexibility and lets the agent exit based on dynamic inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, LangGraph doesn‚Äôt enforce a limit by default, but recursion_limit is the standard way to do it, and we can always layer on additional logic if needed.\n"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

As a language model integration framework, LangChain\\'s use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Model Context Protocol\\nSummary: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard, open-source framework introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 to standardize the way artificial intelligence (AI) systems like large language models (LLMs) integrate and share data with external tools, systems, and data sources. MCP provides a universal interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts. Following its announcement, the protocol was adopted by major AI providers, including OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\\n\\nPage: Intelligent agent\\nSummary: In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent is an entity that perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously to achieve goals, and may improve its performance through machine learning or by acquiring knowledge. AI textbooks define artificial intelligence as the \"study and design of intelligent agents,\" emphasizing that goal-directed behavior is central to intelligence.\\nA specialized subset of intelligent agents, agentic AI (also known as an AI agent or simply agent), expands this concept by proactively pursuing goals, making decisions, and taking actions over extended periods.\\nIntelligent agents can range from simple to highly complex. A basic thermostat or control system is considered an intelligent agent, as is a human being, or any other system that meets the same criteria‚Äîsuch as a firm, a state, or a biome.\\nIntelligent agents operate based on an objective function, which encapsulates their goals. They are designed to create and execute plans that maximize the expected value of this function upon completion. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a reward function, which allows programmers to shape its desired behavior. Similarly, an evolutionary algorithm\\'s behavior is guided by a fitness function.\\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as abstract functional systems similar to computer programs. To distinguish theoretical models from real-world implementations, abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents‚Äîautonomous computer programs that carry out tasks on behalf of users. They are also referred to using a term borrowed from economics: a \"rational agent\".', name='wikipedia', id='6834985d-2560-407f-8f73-d5fe1eb746b4', tool_call_id='call_b2W2s6U4zHGfSV5sZ4OfFZds')]\n",

Fine-tuning can be done on the entire neural network, or on only a subset of its layers, in which case the layers that are not being fine-tuned are \"frozen\" (i.e., not changed during backpropagation). A model may also be augmented with \"adapters\" that consist of far fewer parameters than the original model, and fine-tuned in a parameter-efficient way by tuning the weights of the adapters and leaving the rest of the model\\'s weights frozen.\\nFor some architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, it is common to keep the earlier layers (those closest to the input layer) frozen, as they capture lower-level features, while later layers often discern high-level features that can be more related to the task that the model is trained on.\\nModels that are pre-trained on large, general corpora are usually fine-tuned by reusing their parameters as a starting point and adding a task-specific layer trained from scratch. Fine-tuning the full model is also common and often yields better results, but is more computationally expensive.\\nFine-tuning is typically accomplished via supervised learning, but there are also techniques to fine-tune a model using weak supervision. Fine-tuning can be combined with a reinforcement learning from human feedback-based objective to produce language models such as ChatGPT (a fine-tuned version of GPT models) and Sparrow.\\n\\nPage: List of datasets for machine-learning research\\nSummary: These datasets are used in machine learning (ML) research and have been cited in peer-reviewed academic journals. Datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. Major advances in this field can result from advances in learning algorithms (such as deep learning), computer hardware, and, less-intuitively, the availability of high-quality training datasets. High-quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. Although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce.\\nMany organizations, including governments, publish and share their datasets. The datasets are classified, based on the licenses, as Open data and Non-Open data.\\nThe datasets from various governmental-bodies are presented in List of open government data sites. The datasets are ported on open data portals. They are made available for searching, depositing and accessing through interfaces like Open API.  The datasets are made available as various sorted types and subtypes.', name='wikipedia', id='6da267a9-9b46-492e-96fa-739752762e9e', tool_call_id='call_xpYdgOQmwga0LOEzu5j7CL3y'), ToolMessage(content='Page: Data parallelism\\nSummary: Data parallelism is parallelization across multiple processors in parallel computing environments. It focuses on distributing the data across different nodes, which operate on the data in parallel. It can be applied on regular data structures like arrays and matrices by working on each element in parallel. It contrasts to task parallelism as another form of parallelism.\\nA data parallel job on an array of n elements can be divided equally among all the processors. Let us assume we want to sum all the elements of the given array and the time for a single addition operation is Ta time units. In the case of sequential execution, the time taken by the process will be n√óTa time units as it sums up all the elements of an array. On the other hand, if we execute this job as a data parallel job on 4 processors the time taken would reduce to (n/4)√óTa + merging overhead time units. Parallel execution results in a speedup of 4 over sequential execution. The locality of data references plays an important part in evaluating the performance of a data parallel programming model. Locality of data depends on the memory accesses performed by the program as well as the size of the cache.\\n\\nPage: Ari Holtzman\\nSummary: Ari Holtzman is a professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago and an expert in the area of Natural language processing and Computational linguistics. Previously, Holtzman was a PhD student at the University of Washington where he was advised by Luke Zettlemoyer.\\nIn 2017, he was a member of the winning team for the inaugural Alexa Prize for developing a conversational AI system for the Amazon Alexa device.

LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\\n\\n', name='wikipedia', id='88a00d56-050f-4f9d-9fda-1b448860eb57', tool_call_id='call_eTHOsGsPBWrohTxsmQ1Duy8j'), ToolMessage(content='Page: Attention (machine learning)\\nSummary: In machine learning, attention is a  method that determines the importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that sequence. In natural language processing, importance is represented by \"soft\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size.\\nUnlike \"hard\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \"soft\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system, but a more recent design, namely the transformer, removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme.\\nInspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of using information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Transformer (deep learning architecture)\\nSummary: In deep learning, transformer is an architecture based on the multi-head attention mechanism, in which text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished. \\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) on large (language) datasets.\\n\\nThe modern version of the transformer was proposed in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by researchers at Google. Transformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Machine learning\\nSummary: Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\\nStatistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning. \\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.', name='wikipedia', id='a6655f8b-98e2-4b79-acd3-d229fe236247', tool_call_id='call_90ytXeyLg0IDtTMwev3gEHHd')]\n",

It involves adding trainable low-rank matrices to existing model weights, allowing for parameter-efficient adaptation without updating the entire model. This approach reduces computational costs and memory requirements, making it easier to adapt large pre-trained models to specific tasks.\\n\\nTim Dettmers is a researcher known for his work in machine learning and natural language processing. He has contributed to the development of efficient training methods and model architectures, and is active in the AI research community.\\n\\nAttention in machine learning is a mechanism that determines the importance of different parts of a sequence relative to each other. It assigns weights to each component, such as words in a sentence, to focus on the most relevant information. This concept is fundamental to transformer models, which have revolutionized natural language processing by enabling models to consider all parts of the input simultaneously, rather than sequentially.\\n\\nWould you like more detailed information on any of these topics?', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 207, 'prompt_tokens': 2162, 'total_tokens': 2369, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-BtC9PircdT5qT1kEjOgmHVY3ofC4d', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--aa3bca3c-d442-4461-8d7e-46b491c97883-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2162, 'output_tokens': 207, 'total_tokens': 2369, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})]\n",
