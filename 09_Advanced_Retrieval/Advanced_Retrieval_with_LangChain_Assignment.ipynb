For example, several complainants reported not receiving notices about loan transfers or the start of repayment, leading to unintentional delinquency and negative credit impacts.\\n\\n2. **Compounding interest and unfavorable repayment options:** Borrowers faced growing debts because interest continued to accrue even during forbearance or deferment periods. Lowering monthly payments often resulted in interest compounding, which increased the total debt over time, making it difficult or impossible to pay off the loans fully.\\n\\n3. **Inadequate or confusing loan management practices:** Complaints indicate mismanagement by loan servicers, including failing to provide detailed breakdowns of loan balances, interest calculations, or appropriate options to pay down principal faster. Some borrowers were placed repeatedly on long-term forbearance, which prolonged debt buildup instead of resolving it.\\n\\n4. **Financial hardships and economic factors:** Many borrowers experienced financial hardships, stagnant wages, or unemployment, which made it difficult to increase payments or pay off loans, especially when their options were limited or were extended by policies that did not address individual circumstances.\\n\\n5. **Issues with loan reporting and data mishandling:** Some complaints mention incorrect reporting of late payments, delinquency, or transfer of loans without proper notification, further impairing credit scores and increasing the perceived difficulty of repayment.\\n\\nIn summary, failure to pay back loans was often due to a combination of insufficient communication, interest accumulation during deferments, mismanagement by servicers, and economic hardships that made meeting repayment obligations challenging.'"

    "#### ❓ Question #1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Give an example query where BM25 is better than embeddings and justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 (Best Matching 25) excels over embedding-based retrieval when dealing with queries that require exact keyword matching, specific identifiers, or rare/technical terms. Here's a detailed example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Query:** `\"Complaint ID 12686613 Nelnet forbearance XX/XX/XXXX\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Justification:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Why BM25 Performs Better:**\n",
    "- **Exact Term Matching**: BM25 uses term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) to find documents containing the exact terms. It will give high scores to documents containing \"12686613\", \"Nelnet\", and \"forbearance\".\n",
    "- **Rare Term Importance**: The complaint ID \"12686613\" is extremely rare (appears in only one document), so BM25's IDF component gives it very high weight.\n",
    "- **No Semantic Confusion**: BM25 doesn't try to find \"similar\" complaint IDs - it looks for the exact match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why Embeddings Struggle:**\n",
    "- **Number Representation**: Embedding models often poorly represent specific numbers like \"12686613\". During training, they learn semantic relationships, not memorize specific IDs.\n",
    "- **Semantic Averaging**: Embeddings create a dense vector representing the \"meaning\" of the entire query, which can dilute the importance of the specific ID.\n",
    "- **No Exact Match Guarantee**: Even if semantically similar, embeddings might return complaints about other Nelnet issues or different forbearance cases, missing the specific requested complaint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Real-World Example from the Dataset:**\n",
    "When searching for this specific complaint, BM25 would directly retrieve:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While embeddings might return semantically related but different complaints about:\n",
    "- Other Nelnet payment issues (different complaint IDs)\n",
    "- Other forbearance problems (different companies)\n",
    "- General payment re-amortization issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. When to Use Each:**\n",
    "- **Use BM25**: Legal document search, finding specific case numbers, product SKUs, error codes, technical documentation with specific terms\n",
    "- **Use Embeddings**: Conceptual queries like \"why are people unhappy with their loans\", finding similar problems regardless of specific wording"

    "#### ❓ Question #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how generating multiple reformulations of a user query can improve recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating multiple reformulations of a user query significantly improves recall by capturing different ways the same information might be expressed in the documents. Here's a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Multi-Query Retrieval?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Query Retrieval works by:\n",
    "1. Taking the original user query\n",
    "2. Using an LLM to generate 3-5 alternative versions of the same question\n",
    "3. Running retrieval for each query variant\n",
    "4. Combining all unique retrieved documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Improves Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Vocabulary Mismatch Problem:**\n",
    "- **Original Query**: \"Why did people fail to pay back their loans?\"\n",
    "- **Document Language**: Might use terms like \"default\", \"delinquency\", \"non-payment\", \"missed payments\", \"account past due\"\n",
    "- **Solution**: Multiple queries capture these variations\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Example with Reformulations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Query: **\"Why did people fail to pay back their loans?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM-Generated Reformulations:\n",
    "- \"What caused borrowers to default on their loans?\"\n",
    "- \"What are the reasons for loan delinquency?\"\n",
    "- \"Why couldn't consumers make their loan payments?\"\n",
    "- \"What led to non-payment of student loans?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. How Each Query Finds Different Documents:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Query 1: \"fail to pay back\" might retrieve:\n",
    "- Documents mentioning \"failure to repay\"\n",
    "- Documents about \"unable to pay back\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query 2: \"default\" might retrieve:\n",
    "- Legal documents using formal terminology\n",
    "- Documents about \"defaulted loans\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query 3: \"delinquency\" might retrieve:\n",
    "- Official reports using banking terminology\n",
    "- Documents about \"delinquent accounts\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query 4: \"couldn't make payments\" might retrieve:\n",
    "- Personal narratives using casual language\n",
    "- Documents about \"missed payments\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Real-World Impact on Recall:**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the loan complaints dataset:\n",
    "- **Single Query**: Might retrieve 10 documents mentioning \"fail to pay\"\n",
    "- **Multi-Query**: Could retrieve 25-30 unique documents by finding:\n",
    "  - Complaints using \"default\" (formal language)\n",
    "  - Complaints using \"can't afford\" (informal language)\n",
    "  - Complaints using \"delinquent\" (technical language)\n",
    "  - Complaints using \"behind on payments\" (colloquial language)\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Mathematical Perspective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If each query has 70% recall individually but captures slightly different document sets:\n",
    "- Single query recall: 70%\n",
    "- Multiple queries combined: Could achieve 85-95% recall due to union of results\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Synonym Coverage**: Captures different ways of expressing the same concept\n",
    "- **Perspective Diversity**: Formal vs. informal language, technical vs. layman terms\n",
    "- **Context Variations**: Different phrasings reveal different aspects of the same issue\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Less sensitive to specific word choices in the original query\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Trade-offs:**\n",
    "- **Increased Latency**: Multiple retrieval calls take more time\n",
    "- **Higher Computational Cost**: More embedding comparisons\n",
    "- **Potential Noise**: May retrieve some less relevant documents\n",
    "- **Deduplication Needed**: Same document might be retrieved multiple times"

For example, complaints involving Nelnet Inc. from IN and NM, and Maximus Federal Services from WA, all indicated responses were timely.\\n\\nHowever, the context also mentions multiple complaints where consumers did not receive responses or did not have their complaints handled promptly, such as the case with EdFinancial Services from NY, which was also marked as \"Closed with explanation,\" but the narrative suggests ongoing issues and disputes.\\n\\nSince the specific question is whether any complaints did **not** get handled in a timely manner, the overall data suggests that most complaints labeled \"Timely response: Yes\" were addressed promptly. Those marked \"Company response to consumer: None\" or involving ongoing disputes could imply delayed or unhandled responses, but without explicit labels for untimely responses, it\\'s difficult to conclusively identify any complaints explicitly marked as not handled in a timely manner.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**  \\nBased on the information provided, most complaints appear to have been handled in a timely manner; there is no clear evidence in the data indicating complaints that were not handled promptly. If you need a definitive answer, I would say:  \\n\\n**I do not know** for certain if any complaints were specifically not handled in a timely manner, as the provided data mostly shows timely responses or ongoing disputes without explicit remarks on delays.'"

    "#### ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with short, highly repetitive sentences like FAQs, semantic chunking can exhibit problematic behaviors that require specific adjustments. Here's a detailed analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Semantic Chunking Would Behave with FAQs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Over-Fragmentation Problem:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example FAQ content:\n",
    "Q: How do I reset my password?\n",
    "A: Click on \"Forgot Password\" on the login page.\n",
    "Q: How do I change my email?\n",
    "A: Go to Settings > Profile > Email.\n",
    "Q: How do I update my payment method?\n",
    "A: Navigate to Settings > Billing > Payment Methods.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior**: Each Q&A pair might be split into separate chunks because:\n",
    "- Short sentences have less semantic overlap\n",
    "- Questions have different semantic signatures than answers\n",
    "- Similar questions might not be similar enough to group together\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Similarity Threshold Issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "With `percentile` breakpoint threshold:\n",
    "- **Problem**: Short sentences create extreme distance distributions\n",
    "- **Result**: Either everything groups together (threshold too high) or nothing groups (threshold too low)\n",
    "- **Example**: All \"How do I...\" questions might incorrectly merge into one massive chunk\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Context Loss:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original FAQ:\n",
    "Q: What is forbearance?\n",
    "A: A temporary pause on loan payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "After chunking might become:\n",
    "Chunk 1: \"What is forbearance?\"\n",
    "Chunk 2: \"A temporary pause on loan payments.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Q&A relationship is lost!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjustments to the Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Implement Structural Awareness:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Instead of pure semantic chunking, use pattern recognition\n",
    "def structure_aware_chunking(documents):\n",
    "    chunks = []\n",
    "    current_chunk = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for sentence in documents:\n",
    "        if sentence.startswith(\"Q:\") and current_chunk:\n",
    "            # New question found, save previous Q&A pair\n",
    "            chunks.append(\" \".join(current_chunk))\n",
    "            current_chunk = [sentence]\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            current_chunk.append(sentence)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return chunks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Adjust Similarity Thresholds:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# For FAQs, use different thresholds\n",
    "semantic_chunker = SemanticChunker(\n",
    "    embeddings,\n",
    "    breakpoint_threshold_type=\"percentile\",\n",
    "    breakpoint_threshold_amount=95  # Higher threshold for short texts\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Use Hybrid Approach:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Combine structural and semantic signals\n",
    "def hybrid_faq_chunking(documents):\n",
    "    # Step 1: Group by structure (Q&A pairs)\n",
    "    qa_pairs = group_qa_pairs(documents)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Step 2: Apply semantic chunking on grouped pairs\n",
    "    semantic_groups = []\n",
    "    for qa_pair in qa_pairs:\n",
    "        # Group similar Q&A pairs together\n",
    "        semantic_groups.extend(\n",
    "            semantic_chunker.split_text(qa_pair)\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return semantic_groups\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Implement Minimum Chunk Size:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Ensure chunks have minimum context\n",
    "MIN_CHUNK_SIZE = 3  # At least Q + A + buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "def adjusted_semantic_chunking(sentences):\n",
    "    chunks = semantic_chunker.split_text(sentences)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Merge chunks that are too small\n",
    "    merged_chunks = []\n",
    "    current_chunk = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for chunk in chunks:\n",
    "        current_chunk.append(chunk)\n",
    "        if len(current_chunk) >= MIN_CHUNK_SIZE:\n",
    "            merged_chunks.append(\" \".join(current_chunk))\n",
    "            current_chunk = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return merged_chunks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Use Different Breakpoint Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For FAQs, consider switching from `percentile` to:\n",
    "- **`gradient`**: Better for detecting sharp transitions between topics\n",
    "- **`standard_deviation`**: More stable with repetitive content\n",
    "- **Custom thresholds**: Based on FAQ structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Better for FAQs\n",
    "semantic_chunker = SemanticChunker(\n",
    "    embeddings,\n",
    "    breakpoint_threshold_type=\"gradient\",\n",
    "    number_of_chunks=None  # Let gradient method decide\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Pre-processing Strategy:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def preprocess_faqs(faq_text):\n",
    "    # Group Q&A pairs first\n",
    "    qa_pairs = []\n",
    "    lines = faq_text.split('\\n')\n",
    "    \n",
    "    i = 0\n",
    "    while i < len(lines):\n",
    "        if lines[i].startswith('Q:'):\n",
    "            question = lines[i]\n",
    "            answer = lines[i+1] if i+1 < len(lines) else \"\"\n",
    "            qa_pairs.append(f\"{question} {answer}\")\n",
    "            i += 2\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            i += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return qa_pairs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Solution for FAQs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't rely solely on semantic chunking** - Use structural patterns\n",
    "2. **Preserve Q&A relationships** - Never separate questions from their answers\n",
    "3. **Group similar FAQs** - Combine semantic similarity with structural patterns\n",
    "4. **Set appropriate thresholds** - Higher thresholds for short, repetitive content\n",
    "5. **Consider alternative chunking** - Fixed-size or pattern-based chunking might work better\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Implementation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# For FAQ-specific content\n",
    "class FAQChunker:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, embeddings):\n",
    "        self.embeddings = embeddings\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def chunk_faqs(self, faq_documents):\n",
    "        # Step 1: Extract Q&A pairs\n",
    "        qa_pairs = self.extract_qa_pairs(faq_documents)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Step 2: Group similar topics\n",
    "        topic_groups = self.group_by_topic(qa_pairs)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Step 3: Create chunks maintaining structure\n",
    "        chunks = []\n",
    "        for topic in topic_groups:\n",
    "            chunk = \"\\n\".join(topic)\n",
    "            chunks.append(chunk)\n",
    "            \n",
    "        return chunks\n",
