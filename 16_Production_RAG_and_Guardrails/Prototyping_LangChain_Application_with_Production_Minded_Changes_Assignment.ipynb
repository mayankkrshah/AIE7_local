    "The process of embedding is typically very time consuming and expensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Send text to OpenAI API endpoint\n",
    "2. Wait for processing  \n",
    "3. Receive response\n",
    "4. Pay for API call\n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs *every single time* a document gets converted into a vector representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Caching Solution:**\n",
    "1. Check local cache for previously computed embeddings\n",
    "2. If found: Return cached vector (instant, free)\n",
    "3. If not found: Call OpenAI API, store result in cache\n",
    "4. Return vector representation\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Response Caching:**\n",
    "Similarly, we cache LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls for identical prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- ⚡ Faster response times (cache hits are instant)\n",

    "##### ❓ Question #1: Production Caching Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs**\n",
    "- **Cache invalidation strategies** \n",
    "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
    "- **Cache size management**\n",
    "- **Cold start scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: There is no single correct answer here! Discuss the trade-offs with your group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This caching implementation is useful, but several production gaps should be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory vs Disk Trade-offs:**\n",
    "In-memory is fastest but bounded. Correcting the sizing: with 1536‑d float32 embeddings (~6 KB/vector), 10,000 vectors ≈ ~60 MB (not 60 GB), 1M ≈ ~6 GB; float16 halves this. Use a hybrid approach: hot items in RAM, warm set in Redis/disk, very large corpora in a vector DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Invalidation:**\n",
    "Adopt versioned keys derived from content hashes (or document version IDs) to prevent stale reads. Pair with TTLs and event-driven invalidation on document updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concurrent Access (Stampede Protection):**\n",
    "Coalesce duplicate misses with single-flight deduplication, use distributed locks (e.g., Redis SETNX), and add jittered TTLs to avoid synchronized expirations. Apply per-tenant rate limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cache Size Management:**\n",
    "Enforce memory caps with LRU/LFU/segmented-LRU, per-namespace/tenant quotas, TTLs, and a background sweeper. Track and alert on eviction rates and memory pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cold Start Scenarios:**\n",
    "Persist cache state (e.g., Redis with RDB/AOF), pre-warm hot keys on deploy, and snapshot/warm from recent traffic to reduce thundering herd effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security & Compliance:**\n",
    "Avoid caching PII or encrypt sensitive payloads; separate keyspaces and apply short TTLs for sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observability:**\n",
    "Measure hit/miss ratio, tail latencies, eviction count, stampede dedupe rate, and memory usage; alert on regressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Useful For:**\n",
    "- Development and prototyping\n",
    "- Small-scale apps with limited document sets (<1000 docs)\n",
    "- Low-concurrency scenarios\n",
    "- Demos with predictable query patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Least Useful For:**\n",
    "- High-traffic, 24/7 systems without persistence\n",
    "- Multi-tenant environments without quotas/isolation\n",
    "- Frequently updated content without versioned invalidation\n",

      "In California, common repayment timelines for student loans can vary based on the type of loan and repayment plan chosen. Here are some key points regarding repayment timelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Standard Repayment Plan**: This plan typically requires borrowers to repay their loans in fixed monthly payments over a period of 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Income-Driven Repayment Plans**: These plans adjust monthly payments based on the borrower's income and family size. Common options include:\n",
      "   - **Income-Based Repayment (IBR)**: Payments are either 10% or 15% of discretionary income, depending on when the borrower took out their first loans, but never more than what would be paid under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan.\n",
      "   - **Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)**: Payments are the lesser of 20% of discretionary income or the amount that would be paid on a fixed payment plan over 12 years, adjusted according to income.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Loan Forgiveness Programs**: Borrowers may qualify for forgiveness of the remaining balance of their federal loans after making 120 qualifying payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer, such as in public service or certain healthcare roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **California State Loan Repayment Program (SLRP)**: This program is designed to increase the number of healthcare providers in underserved areas and may offer loan repayment assistance for those who commit to working in these areas.\n",

    "   - What caching strategies work best for each agent type?\n",
    "   - How would you implement rate limiting and circuit breakers?\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Agent Type Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Agent** (Linear execution)\n",
    "- ✅ **Advantages:** Fast (2-5s), low cost (1 LLM call), predictable latency, simple debugging, high throughput\n",
    "- ❌ **Disadvantages:** No quality validation, no self-correction, tool-dependent quality\n",
    "- 🎯 **Use cases:** High-volume support, real-time chat, cost-sensitive applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpfulness Agent** (Multi-stage with evaluation)\n",
    "- ✅ **Advantages:** Self-improving, quality assurance, better satisfaction, adaptive behavior\n",
    "- ❌ **Disadvantages:** Higher latency (4-15s), increased costs (2-4x calls), complex debugging\n",
    "- 🎯 **Use cases:** Education, professional services, complex support, low volume/high quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Production Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Latency Impact:** Simple 3-5s vs Helpfulness 4-12s  \n",
    "• **Mitigation:** Set max_refinements=1, use fast evaluation models, cache results\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Cost Analysis:** Simple 1 LLM call vs Helpfulness 2-4 calls  \n",
    "• **Optimization:** Leverage embedding cache speedup, cache evaluation scores\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Monitoring Strategy:** Track response times, tool usage distribution, success rates, cost per query using LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scalability Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Load Performance:** Simple scales linearly (100+ concurrent), Helpfulness non-linear (30-50% capacity)\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Caching Strategy:** Both benefit from embedding/LLM/RAG cache. Helpfulness adds evaluation cache layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Rate Limiting:** Simple 100/min, Helpfulness 30/min  \n",
    "• **Circuit Breaker:** 5 failures → 30s timeout → fallback to simple agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Recommendation:** Start with Simple Agent (proven architecture with production caching). Evolve to Helpfulness Agent when quality requirements justify 2x cost increase and latency overhead."

    "## Task 4: Guardrails Integration for Production Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll integrate **Guardrails AI** into our production system to ensure our agents operate safely and within acceptable boundaries. Guardrails provide essential safety layers for production LLM applications by validating inputs, outputs, and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ What are Guardrails?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails are specialized validation systems that help \"catch\" when LLM interactions go outside desired parameters. They operate both **pre-generation** (input validation) and **post-generation** (output validation) to ensure safe, compliant, and on-topic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Categories:**\n",
    "- **Topic Restriction**: Ensure conversations stay on-topic\n",
    "- **PII Protection**: Detect and redact sensitive information  \n",
    "- **Content Moderation**: Filter inappropriate language/content\n",
    "- **Factuality Checks**: Validate responses against source material\n",
    "- **Jailbreak Detection**: Prevent adversarial prompt attacks\n",
    "- **Competitor Monitoring**: Avoid mentioning competitors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Benefits of Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏢 Enterprise Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data protection\n",
    "- **Brand Safety**: Maintain consistent, appropriate communication tone\n",
    "- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce liability from inappropriate AI responses\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure factual accuracy and relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚡ Technical Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Layered Defense**: Multiple validation stages for robust protection\n",
    "- **Selective Enforcement**: Different guards for different use cases\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Fast validation without sacrificing accuracy\n",
    "- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with LangGraph agent workflows\n"

    "\n",
    "**Your Mission**: Enhance the existing LangGraph agent by adding a **Guardrails validation node** that ensures all interactions are safe, on-topic, and compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
    "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
    "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
    "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
    "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
    "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
    "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
    "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
    "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
    "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
    "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
    "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
    "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
    "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
    "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
    "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
    "- Consider guard performance vs security trade-offs\n"
