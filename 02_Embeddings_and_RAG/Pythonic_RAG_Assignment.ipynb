        "\n",
        "The default embedding dimension of `text-embedding-3-small` is 1536, as noted above. \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Is there any way to modify this dimension?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, OpenAI provides a way to modify the embedding dimension when using the text-embedding-3-small model. By default, this model outputs a 1536-dimensional vector, but we can reduce this size by using the optional dimensions parameter in the API request.\n",
        "For example, to get a smaller embedding (e.g., 256 dimensions), your API request would look like this:\n",
        "{\n",
        "      \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n",
        "      \"input\": \"Input text here\",\n",
        "      \"dimensions\": 256\n",
        "}\n",
        "We can set the dimensions parameter to any integer between 1 and 1536, depending on your needs. Reducing the dimension can significantly improve performance in terms of speed, memory usage, and storage—especially for large-scale or latency-sensitive applications—while still retaining strong semantic performance, thanks to how the model is trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What technique does OpenAI use to achieve this?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI uses a technique called Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to enable flexible embedding sizes in the text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large models. This allows users to generate high-quality embeddings at reduced dimensions — such as 256, 512, or any value up to the default 1536 — without retraining the model or sacrificing much accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is Matryoshka Representation Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is inspired by Russian nesting dolls, where smaller dolls fit perfectly inside larger ones. Similarly, in MRL:\n",
        "\n",
        "The earliest dimensions of the embedding vector (e.g., the first 256 values) are trained to hold the most important semantic information.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you add more dimensions (e.g., going from 256 → 512 → 1536), you add progressively more detail, but the core meaning is already captured early on.\n",
        "This makes it possible to truncate embeddings to a smaller size while still retaining meaningful and useful representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "How does it work during training?\n",
        "OpenAI explicitly trains the embedding model to optimize partial vectors — that is, the prefixes of the full-length embedding are treated as standalone representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "So instead of training just for one fixed-length vector:\n",
        "\n",
        "The model learns to make smaller slices of the vector (e.g., first 128, 256, etc.) semantically strong.\n",
        "This is done by applying special training objectives that encourage each subset of the vector to perform well on downstream tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not simple truncation — it's a deliberate and efficient design choice baked into the training pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is this useful?\n",
        "MRL enables powerful flexibility and real-world efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Dynamic trade-offs:\n",
        "Use 256 dimensions for fast, low-memory inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the full 1536 dimensions when you need top-tier semantic accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ No retraining needed:\n",
        "You can switch between embedding sizes just by changing a parameter in the API.\n",
        "\n",
        "No need to fine-tune or modify the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Efficient storage and search:\n",
        "Smaller embeddings reduce storage footprint, improve vector database speed, and optimize similarity search performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Seamless integration:\n",

        "\n",
        "What are the benefits of using an `async` approach to collecting our embeddings?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Using an async (asynchronous) approach to collect embeddings offers major advantages in terms of speed, efficiency, and scalability — especially when working with multiple texts or building production-grade systems. In a synchronous (sync) approach, each embedding request is sent one at a time. The program waits for the first request to finish before moving on to the next, which can be painfully slow when processing large batches.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, async allows you to send multiple requests at the same time without blocking the execution of your code. This means you can launch 10, 50, or even 100 embedding requests concurrently, and your program will continue running while the responses are being processed in the background. As a result, you save time and make better use of available resources — especially important when working with APIs that involve network latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, imagine you have 1,000 product descriptions and you want to embed them using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small model. With a synchronous approach, it might take several minutes to send and receive all 1,000 requests, one after another. But with an asynchronous approach, you can batch and fire off many of those requests in parallel — cutting the total time down to a fraction, depending on how many concurrent requests your environment and rate limits support.\n",
        "\n",
        "Async is particularly useful in modern Python ecosystems where tools like asyncio, aiohttp, or frameworks like FastAPI are commonly used. These tools allow developers to build highly responsive systems — like search engines, chatbots, or document-processing pipelines — where latency and throughput actually matter. With async, your app won’t freeze or bottleneck while waiting for each embedding to complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, using an async approach to collect embeddings improves speed, reduces latency, scales better with workload size, and allows for more responsive and efficient systems. It’s the preferred method when dealing with multiple embedding calls or real-time user interactions.\n",

        "\n",
        "When calling the OpenAI API - are there any ways we can achieve more reproducible outputs?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, there are several ways to achieve more reproducible and consistent outputs when using the OpenAI API. While language models are inherently probabilistic, OpenAI provides parameters that allow developers to reduce randomness and make the output more deterministic, especially for testing, debugging, or production use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. seed – Sets the random seed for generation (available in newer models like gpt-4-turbo), making outputs deterministic for the same input and settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. temperature – Lower values (especially 0) reduce randomness, making the model more predictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. top_p – Use a fixed value like 1.0 to control sampling range and reduce output variability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Consistent prompt – Even small differences in wording or formatting can lead to different outputs, so keep the prompt exactly the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Fixed model version – Always specify a model snapshot (e.g., gpt-4-0613) to avoid changes from future model updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. max_tokens and stop – Limit output length and define clear stopping points to prevent unnecessary variation.\n",

            "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on what you want to achieve, but here are a few guidelines to ensure your loop is efficient, readable, and Pythonic:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. **Use `for` Loops for Iterables**\n",
            "When you need to iterate over a collection (like a list, tuple, or string), a `for` loop is usually the best choice. It’s clean and easy to understand. Here’s an example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
            "for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "    print(fruit)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Use `while` Loops for Conditional Iteration**\n",
            "If you need to loop until a specific condition is met, a `while` loop is suitable. Make sure to update the condition within the loop to avoid infinite loops:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "count = 0\n",
            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(count)\n",
            "    count += 1\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. **Use List Comprehensions**\n",
            "For simple loops that create lists, consider using list comprehensions. They are concise and often quicker:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "print(squares)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. **Avoid Bare `break` Statements**\n",
            "While `break` can be useful, it's generally better to avoid using it unless absolutely necessary. Create clearer exit conditions instead.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. **Consider `enumerate` for Indexes**\n",
            "If you need access to the index of elements in a list during iteration, use `enumerate()`:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']\n",
            "for index, color in enumerate(colors):\n",
            "    print(f\"{index}: {color}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. **Use `zip` for Iterating Multiple Lists**\n",
            "If you need to loop through multiple lists simultaneously, `zip()` is very handy:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\n",
            "ages = [25, 30, 35]\n",
            "for name, age in zip(names, ages):\n",
            "    print(f\"{name} is {age} years old.\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 7. **Keep It Readable**\n",
            "Always prioritize readability. If a loop is overly complex, consider refactoring it into a function.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 8. **Don’t Forget to Handle Exceptions**\n",
            "If you're performing operations inside a loop that might fail (like file I/O or network requests), be sure to handle exceptions appropriately.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the best way to write a loop involves choosing the right type of loop for the task, maintaining clarity, and adhering to Pythonic practices. If you have specific use cases or scenarios in mind, feel free to share, and I’d be happy to provide more tailored guidance!\n"

This often occurs as a result of the CEO's difficulty in letting go of the function that initially contributed to their success. The example given in the context is of Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who had been a successful TV network executive but saw the ABC network fall to fourth place after he acquired it. Eisner expressed a belief that he could personally turn around ABC if he had more time, which emphasizes the issue of executive overconfidence and the risks of surrounding oneself with weaker talent to maintain a sense of control or superiority in a formerly held role.\n",

        "What prompting strategies could you use to make the LLM have a more thoughtful, detailed response?\n",

        "What is that strategy called?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "To generate more thoughtful, detailed, and structured responses from a large language model (LLM), a highly effective prompting strategy is to encourage the model to reason step by step. This involves crafting the prompts in a way that guides the model to explain its logic or thought process before arriving at a final answer. For example, we can include phrases like:\n",
        "\n",
        "“Let’s think step by step.”\n",
        "“Explain your reasoning.”\n",
        "“Break it down.”\n",
        "“Walk through this logically.”\n",
        "\n",
        "These types of cues prompt the model to simulate a human-like chain of reasoning, which typically leads to more accurate and well-explained answers — especially when dealing with complex, multi-step problems or tasks that involve logic, math, planning, or causal thinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "This strategy is formally known as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chain-of-Thought prompting works by unlocking the model’s ability to reason in natural language. Rather than providing a quick, surface-level answer, the model is encouraged to show its work — much like a student explaining how they solved a math problem. This makes the output not only more reliable but also easier to audit and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Without Chain-of-Thought Prompting:\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: If a pen costs $2 and a notebook costs $5, how much do three pens and two notebooks cost?\n",

        "\n",
        "Q: If a pen costs $2 and a notebook costs $5, how much do three pens and two notebooks cost? Let’s think step by step.\n",
        "A: One pen costs $2, so three pens cost 3 × $2 = $6. One notebook costs $5, so two notebooks cost 2 × $5 = $10. Total cost is $6 + $10 = $16.\n",
